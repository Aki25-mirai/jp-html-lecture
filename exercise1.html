	<article><h2>Biography</h2>
	<p>Jennie Kim was born in the Seoul Capital Area, South Korea on January 16, 1996, as an only child.	 When she was eight years old, she went on a trip with her family to Australia and New Zealand.
	While in New Zealand, her mother asked her if she liked the place and if she wanted to stay, Jennie replied "yes". A year later, she was sent to study at Waikowhai Intermediate School in Auckland, New Zealand and lived with a home-stay family. Jennie spoke about her experiences on learning a new language on MBC's special documentary English, Must Change to Survive (2006). During her adolescent years, she dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer.After graduating middle school she transferred to ACG Parnell College.</p>
	<p>Jennie heard about K-pop while residing in New Zealand, finding a particular interest in YG Entertainment's music. Her mother was planning to transfer her to the United States in Florida at the age of 14 so she could become a lawyer or teacher, but Jennie called her mother crying on the phone being against the idea. Jennie thought she might not be able to find work she liked while residing alone in Florida; her family supported her decision and she moved back to South Korea.Jennie participated in an audition held by YG Entertainment that same year and performed Rihanna's "Take a Bow". She later succeeded in joining the label as a trainee. Jennie told High Cut Korea that she was so afraid of strangers and terrible at taking the initiative to be funny, that she could barely say "Hello" during her audition.She initially auditioned as a vocalist, but the company thought she should be a rapper instead since she was the only trainee capable of speaking English, and most of the songs she covered included raps.She attended Cheongdam Middle School and Chungdam High School at the time. </p></article>
